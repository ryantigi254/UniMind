    content: `Feeling the pressure pile up this week. Two essays and a presentation due next Friday. It's hard to know where to start. Tried breaking tasks down like the stress management resources suggest, but my focus keeps drifting. Deep breathing helped a little this morning. Maybe I should try that 7-11 technique mentioned in the blog? Just need to get through this week. Remembering that it's okay to feel stressed, but need to find ways to cope without burning out.`,

    content: `Pushed myself to go to the mixer tonight. Heart was pounding just walking in. Wanted to turn back, but remembered the advice about small steps. Talked to two new people â€“ mostly small talk, but it's a start. Felt awkward, but also a bit proud for not just staying in my room. Loneliness has been hitting hard lately, so trying to connect is important, even if it feels scary. Maybe the next one will be easier?`,

    content: `Finally booked one of those drop-in sessions. Was really nervous beforehand, wasn't sure what to expect or if my problems were 'valid' enough. The person I spoke to was really understanding, didn't feel judged at all. Just talking about feeling low and unmotivated for 20 minutes actually helped lift some weight. They signposted me to some self-help resources on the Student Hub too. Might try the longer counselling sessions if things don't improve.`,

    content: `It hit me hard this week, especially seeing friends back home posting pictures together. Feeling really disconnected here sometimes. It helps talking to family on video calls, but it's not the same. The ISSS info mentioned culture shock and how it's normal. Trying to remind myself of that. Maybe I should check out that international student society meeting next week? Need to find ways to build a sense of community here.`,

Forced me to slow down and just notice the sensations instead of letting my mind race about assignments or worries. Didn't magically fix anything, but it was a nice 5-minute pause. Maybe I can incorporate small mindful moments like this more often.`,

Tried distracting myself, went for a run like the mental health awareness week stuff suggested, which helped temporarily.

Read something about scheduling breaks like appointments. Going to try blocking out time for a walk tomorrow and maybe just reading a book for fun, not for the course.

That voice in my head keeps saying I'm not smart enough and I'll be found out soon. It's exhausting. Remembered reading about imposter syndrome on Student Minds. Knowing it's a common thing helps a tiny bit. Need to focus on my actual progress, not just my fears.`,

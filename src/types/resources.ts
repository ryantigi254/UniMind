    snippet: 'Learn about counselling as a talking therapy providing a safe space.',
    content: `## What is Counselling?

Counselling is a talking therapy that provides a safe and confidential space for you to talk to a trained professional (Counsellor or Therapist) about any issues and concerns.

Sometimes it can be helpful to have someone independent to listen and support, to help you make sense of your situation and find your own answers. Counselling can give you an opportunity to explore, discover and clarify ways of living more resourcefully with a greater sense of fulfilment.

Counselling is a common service that many people will use throughout their lives, not just those with a formally diagnosed mental illness.

*   **Validate & Express Feelings:** Name your emotions. Try journaling ([WRITE method](https://journaltherapy.com/)).
*   **Stay Connected:** Reach out to friends/family. Join clubs/groups. Start small ([Side by Side - Mind](https://sidebyside.mind.org.uk/)).
*   **Review Social Media Use:** Does it nourish or deplete you? Adjust accordingly.

*   Excessive checking/revising

## Strategies for Management

*   **Embrace Mistakes as Learning:** View errors as opportunities for growth.
*   **Practice Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with kindness when you fall short.

    content: \`## Why Self-Care Matters (May 2024 Blog)

Self-care isn't selfish; it's essential for maintaining mental and physical wellbeing, especially during stressful periods like university.

**What is Self-Care?**
It's any activity we do deliberately to take care of our mental, emotional, and physical health. It looks different for everyone.

**Examples:**
*   **Physical:** Getting enough sleep, eating nutritious food, moving your body.
*   **Emotional:** Journaling, talking to a friend, setting boundaries, practicing mindfulness.
*   **Social:** Spending time with loved ones, joining a club, limiting draining interactions.
*   **Mental:** Reading, learning something new, engaging in hobbies, taking breaks from study.

**Making Time:**
*   Schedule small self-care activities into your day/week.
*   Start small - even 5-10 minutes can make a difference.
*   Be kind to yourself if you miss a day.

**Remember:** Self-care helps prevent burnout and improves your ability to cope with challenges.\`,

This chatbot is designed to:

*   Provide information about university mental health resources (based on its knowledge).
*   Offer general information on common mental health topics (e.g., anxiety, stress).
*   Direct you to relevant self-help materials and support services.
*   Answer frequently asked questions about university services (like counselling eligibility).
*   Recognise expressions of distress and provide immediate crisis contact information.

**Limitations:**
*   **Not a Therapist:** Cannot provide counselling, diagnosis, or treatment.
*   **Not for Emergencies:** Cannot handle immediate crises (directs to crisis lines).
*   **Knowledge Limit:** Information is based on the data it was trained on (primarily UON resources provided). It may not have real-time updates or info outside its scope.

*   **General Principle:** Chatbot interactions should be treated with a degree of privacy, but are typically not confidential in the same way as talking to a human counsellor.
*   **Data Usage:** Conversations *may* be logged anonymously for purposes like:
    *   Improving the chatbot's performance and accuracy.
    *   Identifying common user needs and resource gaps.
    *   Training the AI model.
*   **No Personal Identification:** Logs are usually anonymised, meaning they are not linked to your specific name or student ID unless you explicitly provide such information.
*   **Crisis Exception:** If you express clear intent to harm yourself or others, safety protocols might involve escalation, though the chatbot itself cannot directly intervene.

**Recommendation:** Avoid sharing highly sensitive personal details (like specific trauma details, names of others involved in personal issues) that you would only share in a confidential therapeutic setting.\`,
